homebrew-rejected
=================

Some 'open wsman' formulas I've written that were [rejected by homebrew core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/32116).

- sblim-sfcc
- openwsman
- wsmancli


### Installation

Tap this repository:

    brew tap jameskyle/homebrew-rejected

Now you can install what you need with homebrew:

    brew install wsmancli
    brew install sblim-sfcc
    brew install openwsman


### Notes

[open wsman](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openwsman/) is Open source implementation of WS-Management / WinRM. Among other things, it is commonly used to adjust Intel AMT settings and/or [enable KVM control](https://sites.google.com/site/stupidmactricks/home/configuringintelamtkvmforstandardvncport5900usefromlinux) for Intel vPro systems.
